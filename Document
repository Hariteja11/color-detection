5. Dataset
5.1 Description
The dataset utilized in this project is named cleaned_colors.csv, which contains RGB values along with their corresponding color labels. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the machine learning model aimed at classifying colors.




5.2 Dataset Format
The dataset is structured as follows:
R	G	B	Color_Label
255	0	0	Red
0	255	0	Green
0	0	255	Blue
This format allows for straightforward access to RGB values and their associated labels during model training.
5.3 Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
•	Standardizing Column Names: Ensuring uniformity in column names for easier reference.
•	Handling Missing Values: Implementing strategies to address any missing or incorrect data entries.
•	Normalizing RGB Values: Adjusting RGB values to maintain consistency across the dataset.
•	Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance accurately.
6. Methodology
6.1 Image Processing & Color Extraction
The methodology for image processing involves several steps:
1.	The user provides a path to the image file.
2.	The image is loaded into the application and converted from its original format to RGB format for consistency in color representation.
3.	The application applies K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm, to identify dominant colors within the image based on pixel data.
4.	The extracted colors are then visualized through graphical representations, allowing users to easily interpret the results.
6.2 Model Training & Classification
The process of model training consists of:
1.	Loading and preprocessing the dataset (cleaned_colors.csv).
2.	Training a Random Forest Classifier, which is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training time and outputs the mode of their predictions.
3.	Evaluating model accuracy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable classification performance.
4.	Making predictions on new images by applying the trained model to detect colors based on previously unseen data.
6.3 Visualization
Visualization plays a critical role in presenting results:
•	A bar chart is generated to illustrate the dominant colors extracted from an image, providing a clear visual summary of color distribution.
•	Each bar represents a specific color along with its corresponding RGB values, facilitating easy reference for users.
